# Siemens_technical

This is a repository containing the solutions to Siemens project assignments.
Since this is a tester role I´ve decided to add a very simple test scripts for every
solution. The scripts can be run with the **pytest** framework. To run the scripts
simply write **pytest** to your command line. You may need to download the **pytest**
package if you dont have it already installed.


# Palindrome
This is the solution to the first assignment. The task was to create a python script to check
whether a given string taken from command line parameters is a palindrome. A palindrome
is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards.
Example of palindroms : "madam" , "racecar", "eye" , etc. 

# Review
The task was to review a given code, determine what is its purpose and simplify it, if possible.
I´ve determined that the given function was used to remove duplicates from list of items and return
the list with only unique values from the given list.

# Caesar cipher
The task was to create a script to encrypt a message taken from stdin using the caesar´s cipher method.
While it was not specified, I´ve decided to only accept strings which contain only the letters of roman alphabet (lower or upper).
